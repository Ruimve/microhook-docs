# Installation

Microhook is essentially a set of npm [packages](https://github.com/Ruimve/microhook).

To install microhook, use npm:

```bash
npm install microhook
```

Or, if you prefer Yarn:

```bash
yarn add microhook
```

## Requirements

- [React](https://react.zcopy.site/) version 16.8 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

Now you're ready to use microhook in your React applications!
